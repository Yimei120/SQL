## LeetCode 178 
(https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-scores/)

--------------------------------------------------

This question is about Ranking, and most of the time window functions can make life much easier.

* My solution:

~~~~sql
select Score,
dense_RANK() over(order by Score DESC) as Rank;
from Scores
~~~~

------------------------------------------------------------
* My reflections:

*Why we need to use window functions?*

The number of rows in returned table after using window functions will not change compared to that of previous table.

*More window functions...*

###### COUNT() OVER(PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ... DESC/ASC)

###### AVG() OVER(PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ... DESC/ASC)

###### SUM() OVER(PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...DESC/ASC)
