## LeetCode 603 

--------------------------------------------------

One of the typical questions in LeetCode. Copy the table and control the ids.

* My solution:

~~~~sql
select distinct a.seat_id
from cinema a, cinema b
where abs(a.seat_id - b.seat_id) = 1
and a.free = 1
and b.free = 1
order by seat_id
~~~~

------------------------------------------------------------
* My reflections:

  The differences between "join" and just a ","?
  
  The comma will give us rows without duplicates, but join will return all rows.
